# Biography

John provides modeling and statistical support as an independent consultant to his clients, including: a National
Science Foundation research center initiative; the International Whaling Commision, and; The Makah Tribal Council. This work involves evaluating the performance of alternative management strategies and catch limit algorithms using computational statistics. He also prepares testimony as an expert witness under federal judicial oversight of these applications. Previously, he worked as a staff consultant, leading the development of survey designs based on statistical power analysis. Those studies successfully informed operational management decisions for foreign and multinational corporate clients, under multi-billion dollar natural resource development projects.
